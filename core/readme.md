# Vuh Design System

**Vuh** is a project created with the purpose of having a common design system for our company, allowing us to do rapid prototypes. It is comprised of **web components that can be used on any of the major JS front-end frameworks**. This is possible thanks to Stencil JS, a compiler that generates Web Components (more specifically, Custom Elements) and builds high performance web apps.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frameworks into a simple build-time tool:

- Virtual DOM
- Async Rendering
- Reactive Data Binding
- Typescript (yes, configured by default!)
- JSX

For the small minority of browsers that do not support modern browser features and APIs, **_Stencil will automatically polyfill them on-demand_**.

It also has a **_tiny API_** which doesn't need to be learned and re-learned, but rather heavily relies on web standards.

So, if you've worked with React or any other front-end library, you'll feel very comfortable!

## Setting Up the Design System in React

1. Create a new file on your React project's root folder. For this example, we'll call the new file **`register-web-components.ts`**, but feel free to name it however you like.

```js
import {  defineCustomElements,  JSX as LocalJSX, } from '@the-ksquare-group/vuh-stencil-components/loader';
import '@the-ksquare-group/vuh-stencil-components/www/build/vuh-stencil.css';
import { DetailedHTMLProps, HTMLAttributes } from 'react';

type StencilProps<T> = {
 [P in keyof T]?: Omit<T[P], "ref"> | HTMLAttributes<T>;
};

type ReactProps<T> = {
 [P in keyof T]?: DetailedHTMLProps<HTMLAttributes<T[P]>, T[P]>;
};

type StencilToReact<
 T = LocalJSX.IntrinsicElements,
 U = HTMLElementTagNameMap
> = StencilProps<T> & ReactProps<U>;

declare global {
 export namespace JSX {
 interface IntrinsicElements extends StencilToReact {}
 }
}
defineCustomElements(window);
```

2. On your React project's index file, import the file you just created.

```js
import './register-web-components';
```

## Setting Up the Design System in Vue

1. Add the following to your Vue project's **`main.js`** file:

```js
import {
  applyPolyfills,
  defineCustomElements
} from '@the-ksquare-group/vuh-stencil-components/loader';
import '@the-ksquare-group/vuh-stencil-components/www/build/vuh-stencil.css';
// if you want theming options, include your css path
import './custom-global.css';
applyPolyfills().then(() => {
  defineCustomElements();
});
Vue.config.ignoredElements = [/^k-/];
```

## Theming CSS Variables

```css
:root {
  --vuh-primary-color: #1b8df2;
  --vuh-primary-800: #0672d1;
  --vuh-primary-700: #0b7de0;
  --vuh-primary-600: #1986e6;
  --vuh-primary-500: #1b8df2;
  --vuh-primary-400: #339bf5;
  --vuh-primary-300: #45a3f5;
  --vuh-primary-200: #56abf5;
  --vuh-primary-100: #7fbef5;

  --vuh-primary-300-rgb: 69, 163, 245;
  --vuh-primary-100-rgb: 127, 190, 245;
}
```
